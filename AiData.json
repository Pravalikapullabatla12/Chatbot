      "question": "What is acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)?",
      "answer": "Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) helps people accept difficult thoughts and feelings rather than fighting them, while committing to actions aligned with personal values. It uses mindfulness, cognitive defusion (separating from thoughts), values clarification, and behavioral change strategies. Instead of eliminating distress, ACT focuses on creating a meaningful life despite difficult experiences."

      "question": "What is anticipatory anxiety and how can I manage it?",

      "question": "How does culture influence mental health and treatment?",
      "answer": "Culture shapes how people express, experience, and interpret psychological distress, influences what's considered normal versus concerning behavior, affects stigma and help-seeking, determines acceptable treatments, impacts therapeutic relationships, and provides different support systems and coping mechanisms. Culturally responsive care acknowledges these influences while avoiding stereotyping and recognizing individual differences within cultural groups."

    {
      "id": 165,
      "question": "What is the window of tolerance and why is it important?",
      "answer": "The window of tolerance is the optimal arousal zone where we can effectively manage emotions and stress. When within this window, we can think clearly and respond appropriately. Trauma, stress, and mental health conditions can narrow this window, causing frequent hyperarousal (fight/flight) or hypoarousal (freeze/disconnect). Recognizing personal boundaries of this window helps develop regulation skills and expand capacity over time."
    },
    {
      "id": 166,

      "question": "What is vicarious trauma and how can helpers prevent it?",
      "answer": "Vicarious trauma occurs when helping professionals or caregivers experience secondary traumatic stress through exposure to others' suffering. Prevent it through clear boundaries between work and personal life, regular supervision or consultation, diverse caseloads, trauma-informed self-care practices, limiting trauma-related content consumption outside work, maintaining social connections, recognizing early warning signs, and sometimes seeking therapy to process accumulated exposure."

    {
      "id": 168,
      "question": "How does childhood emotional neglect differ from other forms of adversity?",
      "answer": "Unlike more visible forms of adversity, childhood emotional neglect involves the absence of necessary emotional attunement and responsiveness. This omission of emotional validation, comfort, and guidance can be harder to identify because it's about what didn't happen rather than harmful actions. Its impacts include difficulty identifying feelings, self-reliance to a fault, persistent emptiness, low self-worth, and relationship difficulties."

    {
      "id": 169,
      "question": "What is the relationship between mental health and creativity?",
      "answer": "Mental health and creativity share a complex relationship. Creative expression can support wellbeing through emotional processing, meaning-making, and flow states. Conversely, some research suggests certain mental health conditions correlate with creative thinking through unique perspective-taking and cognitive flexibility. However, romanticizing the 'tortured artist' myth is harmful—mental health challenges typically hinder rather than enhance creative output."

    {
